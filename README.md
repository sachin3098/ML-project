# ML-project
<p>This project uses machine learning techniques on historical weather data to predict weather types. The objective is to develop a model that provides accurate weather forecasts by analyzing data patterns and trends.</p>

<p><b>Task</b></p>
<p>To develop a machine learning model that predicts weather types based on historical weather data. The model should accurately classify the weather conditions using the provided dataset.</p>

<p><b>Data description</b></p>
<p>1)Temperature (numeric): The temperature in degrees Celsius, ranging from extreme cold to extreme heat.</p>
<p>2)Humidity (numeric): The humidity percentage, including values above 100% to introduce outliers.</p>
<p>3)Wind Speed (numeric): The wind speed in kilometres per hour, with a range including unrealistically high values.</p>
<p>4)Precipitation (%) (numeric): The precipitation percentage, including outlier values.</p>
<p>5)Cloud Cover (categorical): The cloud cover description.</p>
<p>6)Atmospheric Pressure (numeric): The atmospheric pressure in hPa, covering a wide range.</p>
<p>7)UV Index (numeric): The UV index, indicating the strength of ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p>8)Season (categorical): The season during which the data was recorded.</p>
<p>9)Visibility (km) (numeric): The visibility in kilometres, including very low or very high values.</p>
<p>10)Location (categorical): The type of location where the data was recorded.</p>
<p>11)Weather Type (categorical): The target variable for classification, indicating the weather type.</p>

<p><b>Action</b></p>
<p>1)Import libraries and Load the dataset into a notebook.</p>
<p>2)Perform EDA on the dataset.</p>
<p>3)Separate the labels and target variables.</p>
<p>4)Fit the model using the logistic regression.</p>
<p>5)Generate the pickle file for scaling and for the trained model.</p>
<p>6)create the app.py file, import the pickle file, and from user input, we predict the output.</p>

<p><b>Result</b></p>
<p>1)A CSV file containing the predicted weather type values generated by the model.</p>
